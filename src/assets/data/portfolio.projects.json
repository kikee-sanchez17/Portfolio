  "description": "This application was my final project for my higher degree. My classmate and I wanted to support and promote local cinema, recognizing its cultural significance beyond the dominance of large film industries. To achieve this, we collaborated with a local cinema in Barcelona and developed a fully customized Android application tailored to their needs.\n\nThe app was built using Android Studio with Kotlin as the primary programming language, and it integrates a MySQL relational database to store and manage user information efficiently. One of the main goals was to enhance user engagement by allowing them to create personalized profiles, where they can save their favorite events, delete events, update personal information, and change their passwords.\n\nAdditionally, the app provides essential features for cinema-goers, such as checking movie schedules and exploring the history of the cinema, giving users deeper insight into the venue’s background and its cultural impact.\n\nTo improve security and user experience, I implemented OTP-based password recovery using PHPmailer, ensuring that users can securely reset their passwords if needed. The overall design and functionality of the app were carefully crafted to provide a smooth and intuitive experience, making it easier for the cinema’s audience to stay connected and engaged with their favorite local film screenings.",
